Hi, I'm Jiasheng Gu. At 01.AI, I built the end-to-end training pipeline for proprietary VLMs and LLMs. These include the 25B-A3.5B and 247B-A22B MoE models. All this was used to create a generative AI video editing and mixing product from scratch.

First, I did continued pre-training on a 20-billion-token dataset using Megatron-LM. Then, I set up a two-stage fine-tuning process: SFT and DPO. This made the models better at understanding and clipping video, which is critical for the product.

I’m excited about this opportunity. I’m really interested in robotic foundation models. My background in training models for video perception and reasoning fits well with the challenges in robotics. I believe my experience can contribute to developing foundation models for Project GR00T.
