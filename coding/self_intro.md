Hi, I'm Jiasheng Gu. At 01.ai, I built the end-to-end training pipeline for our own VLMs and LLMs. These include the 25B-A3.5B and 247B-A22B MoE models. All this was to create a generative AI video editing and mixing product from the scratch.

My work covered the whole training process. First, I did continued pre-training on a 20-billion-token dataset using Megatron-LM. Then, I set up a two-stage fine-tuning process: SFT and DPO. This made the models better at understanding and clipping video, which is critical for the product.

I’m excited about this opportunity. I’m really interested in robotic foundation models. My background in training models for video perception and reasoning fits right with the challenges in robotics. I believe my experience can help a lot with developing foundation models for Project GR00T.
